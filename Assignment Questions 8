// Q.1 ====================================================================================================================================

React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs). It was developed by Facebook and is now 
maintained by both Facebook and a large community of developers. React is commonly used for creating interactive and 
dynamic web applications

// Q.2 ====================================================================================================================================


The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming concept used in libraries like React to efficiently update and
render user interfaces. It is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM, which is the HTML structure 
of a web page.


// Q.3 ====================================================================================================================================


Virtual DOM:
      The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM.
      It is used as a tool for optimizing and efficiently updating the UI in libraries
      like React.
Real DOM: 
      The real DOM is the actual HTML structure of a web page. It represents the current 
      state of the UI and provides an interface to manipulate and interact with the 
      elements on the page.


// Q.4 ====================================================================================================================================

In the context of web development, a component is a self-contained, reusable piece of code that encapsulates
the structure, behavior, and presentation of a specific part of a user interface (UI). Components are the
building blocks of most modern web frameworks and libraries, such as React, Vue.js, and Angular.

Functional Components:
Class Components:



// Q.5 ====================================================================================================================================

Functional Components:

Also known as stateless components or presentational components.
Written as JavaScript functions.
Used for simple UI rendering without internal state or lifecycle methods.
Typically receive data as props and return the rendered JSX (UI).

Class Components:

Also known as stateful components or container components.
Written as ES6 classes that extend the base component class provided by the framework or library.
Used for more complex UI logic, managing internal state, and lifecycle methods.
Can hold and modify state, handle user events, and interact with other components.

// Q.6 ====================================================================================================================================

In React, the component lifecycle refers to a series of phases or events that occur during the lifespan of a component.
Each phase has associated methods that can be overridden to perform certain actions or tasks at specific points in the 
component's lifecycle. The React component lifecycle has been divided into three main phases: Mounting, Updating,
and Unmounting.


// Q.7 ====================================================================================================================================

Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing props through multiple layers of components, even if intermediate 
components do not need or use those props. It can occur when components in a nested hierarchy require access to data or
functions that are available higher up in the component tree.
